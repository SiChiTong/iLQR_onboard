Test everything individually by replicating function, testing with multiple
inputs, and comparing vs matlab.
Write tests for functions before starting implementation (if it's simple enough)
Best way to do this - refactor into a standalone function during testing?

Stuff to do (in approximate order)
- LocoCar::cost
- LocoCar::final_cost
- iLQR::get_dynamics_and_cost
- iLQR::init_traj
- step 2 in iLQR_main
- step 3 in iLQR_main
- iLQR::forward_pass
- iLQR::backward_pass
- printing stuff in iLQR_main
- simple version in boxQP
- write final control sequence and states to text file
- test whole thing and see if output looks reasonable
- iLQR::boxQP


Later on:
- refactor to completely separate iLQR class from Model class
- make skeleton for new Model class
