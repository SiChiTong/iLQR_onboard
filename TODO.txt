Test everything individually by replicating function, testing with multiple
inputs, and comparing vs matlab.
Best way to do this? Just make a main in the function file and test on its own?
Will have to gcc or change cmakelists

Stuff to do (in approximate order)
- LocoCar::cost
- LocoCar::final_cost
- iLQR::init_traj
- iLQR::car_dynamics_and_cost
- step 2 in iLQR_main
- step 3 in iLQR_main
- iLQR::forward_pass
- iLQR::backward_pass
- printing stuff in iLQR_main
- simple version in boxQP
- test
- iLQR::boxQP
